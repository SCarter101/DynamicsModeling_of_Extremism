# Dynamics_Modeling_of_Social_Isolation

Abstract — 

Objective: This study conceptualizes radicalization into extremism as a system of human dynamics shaped by social isolation, the inverse of social capital, and examines its progression through a computational model of population vulnerability. Focusing on the Rise Above Movement (RAM), a transnational white supremacist organization, the research introduces a qualitative theoretical framework that divides social isolation into two interrelated dimensions: personal isolation, referring to individual vulnerabilities that heighten susceptibility to recruitment, and controlled isolation, representing the organizational mechanisms through which groups segregate individuals from more diverse social interactions. Method: The dynamics model delineates population identity states ranging from susceptible individuals to violent extremist actors and simulates transitions driven by endogenous variables, such as perceived societal crisis and varying social isolation. Results: Findings on RAM indicate that natural atrophy, changes in family structure, personal circumstances, or evolving worldviews, exert a greater influence on identity transformation than targeted intervention programs. Additionally, personal isolation factors are found to have a stronger effect on population-level behavior than the collective mechanisms of controlled isolation. Conclusions: Effective deterrence policies for deradicalization must consider multiple factors, not just one. These policies should address the role of social isolation in extremism by reducing vulnerabilities from a lack of positive role models and challenging home environments for at-risk individuals, such as RAM. This approach allows for more tailored prevention strategies. 

## Introduction

In Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, he argued that the weakening capacity of communities to integrate diverse groups and resolve conflicts constructively was the result of declining bridging social capital (Putnam:1995). The networks, norms, and trust that allow citizens to cooperate and sustain democratic life had eroded, resulting in declining membership in civic clubs, PTAs, unions, churches, bowling leagues, and other forms of association life (Putnam:2000). While his previous work examined healthy democracies and the strong civic networks that foster interactions among diverse individuals, this study extends that framework by focusing on the dynamics of extremism. This shift allows for a deeper understanding of how such networks might influence or be influenced by extremist ideologies, setting the stage for exploring these complex interactions.

Extremism, often conflated with terrorism to respond to non-violent political expression or to wield counterterrorism applications against political opposition, is understood by the legal framework as the `potentially unlawful use or threat of force or violence to advance an ideological agenda (Foster:2022, Onursal:2021).'  Extremism can exist in racial or ethnic identitarian strongholds, in religious cults, in nationalist movements, and within political or anti-government ideology, just to name a few. In 2024, international extremism deteriorated more than improved, with 45 countries reporting higher episodes of violence, and the number of countries with at least one incident increased from 58 to 66 (IEP:2025). In Europe alone, incidents doubled to 67, with resurgences occurring in Sweden, Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, and Germany, which ranked 27th on the Global Terrorism Index (IEP:2025).

The domestic picture within the United States has also worsened, where incidents have increased by 357\% between 2013 and 2021 (GAO:2023).  Attacks and plots have mainly targeted the government, military, and law enforcement (McCabe:2024), where domestic terrorism poses the greatest threat, since many attacks are enacted by small, disparate groups or lone actors, driven by partisan extremist ideologies or white supremacy (Palmer:2025). What underlying motivations are we missing? What conditions exist that propel an individual into extreme belief, further into extreme groupings, and ultimately into extreme actions? What tools could we use to better understand human behavior within the extremism and radicalization process, to help generate more impactful mitigation strategies? 

The primary purpose of this paper is to: (1) construct a qualitative theoretical framework for social isolation, the inverse of social capital, that analyzes the conditions under which individuals remove themselves from heterogeneous social bonds, and (2) based on this theoretical framework, develop a computational model that simulates the actions and reactions of a vulnerable population, specifically those individuals who are most likely to be recruited by extremist identity groups and propelled towards violence. This effort aims to change how extremism is perceived, illustrating that radicalization should not be viewed as a linear process but rather as a complex system of non-linear influences. These kinds of systems require a way of thinking that distinguishes symptoms from underlying root causes without hyper-prescriptive definitions that ignore root social structures (Stroh:2015). The findings offer a way to shape deterrence policy and expose how social movements operate as human systems, where people function as cogs in a social and economic machine, play an active role within the system's totality, and respond in predictable ways to forces exerted by other parts of the system (Forrester:1991).
