# Dynamics_Modeling_of_Social_Isolation

Abstract — This research models the human behavior of the transnational white supremacist movement, the Rise Above Movement (RAM) in the United States, using a two-part social isolation framework extrapolated from Robert Putnam's work on social capital. This framework explores how personal and controlled isolation mechanisms contribute to the radicalization process, turning susceptible individuals into potentially violent actors. By simulating these interactions, the study seeks to identify how different stimuli, such as a perception of crisis, affect the mobilization and resilience of vulnerable populations within extremist movements. This report finds that while grievances and the perception of crisis impact personal and group dynamics, they hold limited influence over the system compared to de-escalation efforts and natural atrophy to extremism. Through experimentation and simulation, the report also finds that the insertion of random activations, either through real-world events or 'lone wolf' actors, presents minor disruptions to the system instead of significant changes.

## Introduction

Extremism, often conflated with terrorism to respond to non-violent political expression or to wield counterterrorism applications against political opposition, is understood by the legal framework as the “\textit{potentially unlawful use or threat of force or violence to advance an ideological agenda}” \cite{Onursal:2021, Foster:2022}.  Extremism can exist in racial or ethnic identitarian strongholds, in religious cults, in nationalist movements, and within political or anti-government ideology, just to name a few. The complexity of it challenges serious interrogation, as a tendency persists that frames any political or ideological differences as extreme \cite{Berger:2018}. What underlining motives are we missing? What is not captured with surface-level analysis? What tools could we use to better understand human behaviors within the extremism and radicalization process that would help generate more impactful mitigation strategies? 

An approach that could prove helpful is exploring extremism and radicalization as a system of influences, brought about by personal and group-reinforced social isolation, and the compelling perception of a crisis of a social movement. Research has shown a multitude of contributing factors that influence people who engage in extreme beliefs that escalate to accelerationism, or “\textit{the perceived escalation by nefarious entities to advance 'degenerate' values and influences such as multiculturalism, liberalism, and diversity, among others} \cite{ADL:2019}". The objective of using a computational approach is to classify trigger points within a social system that either intensify or moderate these influences, to highlight where potential points of intervention may exist, and to test scenarios where stimuli differ. 

The general goal of this paper is to organize, clarify, and unify commonly accepted knowledge in radicalization research and develop a computational model that simulates the actions and reactions of a vulnerable population or those individuals most recruited by extremist identity groups. This effort hopes to change how extremism is perceived, specifically, to view social movements as human systems where people exist as cogs in a social and economic machine, play an active role within the totality of the system, and respond in predictable ways to forces bearing on them by other parts of the system. \cite{Forrester:1991}. Additionally, the intent is to illustrate that radicalization should not necessarily be investigated as a linear process but as a complex machine of nonlinear influences. These kinds of systems require an alternate way of thinking, one that distinguishes symptoms from underlying root causes without hyper-prescriptive definitions that ignore root social structures \cite{Stroh:2015}. 

In this effort, we model population states of the Rise Above Movement (RAM), a transnational white supremacist movement with an ideology that prioritizes the supremacy of Aryan, white, European American, and primarily Christian identities and their interests \cite{Campbell:2020}. Any identities that do not fit this definition fall under the out-group categorization and are perceived as threats by the movement. The perceived threat from out-groups varies from the Great Replacement Theory that non-Aryan-white ethnicities are plotting to eradicate and replace Aryan-white identities with their own cultures to belief in conspiracies of cultural movement efforts to denigrate the Aryan-white identity as a lesser identity \cite{ADL:2022, Jones:2018}. As the name implies, the movement is increasingly global and multi- or transnational, especially with the increasing use of digital and social networks. However, the focus is on the US segment of this social movement. 

We investigate the impact of social isolation on RAM as a two-part framework of personal and controlled isolation mechanisms that drive the social contagion driving this phenomenon. By mapping the dynamics and adaptive properties of this social system, this research attempts to model how the perception of crisis (social media, propaganda, etc.) drives social isolation, simulate the participation of nontraditional actors, and explore how a vulnerable population could respond to varying stimuli in an equalized system. We find that although the perception of crisis impacts both personal and group dynamics, it has limited influence over the system when compared to de-escalation efforts and natural atrophy to extremism. However, this perception is cheap and enduring, whereas de-escalation efforts come at higher resource costs.  Furthermore, the model illustrates that this natural atrophy, such as family needs, life changes, or perspective changes, has a greater impact on changing states of identity than external de-escalation efforts. The remainder of the paper is organized as an exploration of the social isolation categorizations, methods used to model human behavior, simulation and experimentation results, and the sociological significance of studying RAM using computational methods.
