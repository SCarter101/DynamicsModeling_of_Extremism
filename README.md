# DynamicsModeling_of_Extremism

Abstract — This research examines the transnational white supremacist movement, focusing on the Rise Above Movement (RAM) in the United States, which merges Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) culture with white nationalist ideologies centered around cultural preservation and perceived threats from non-white, non-Christian groups. RAM's decentralized structure, focus on local engagement through “active clubs”, and increased use of digital networks and social media, complicates efforts by law enforcement to counteract their influence. This study proposes a two-part social isolation framework that explores how both personal and controlled isolation mechanisms contribute to the radicalization process, turning susceptible individuals into extremist, and potentially violent, actors. Social contagion within trusted networks reinforces extremist beliefs, drawing individuals deeper into radical ideologies. To understand these dynamics, the research models the system as an adaptive system, examining how perceptions of crisis, propagated through social media and other channels, impact social isolation and vulnerability to radicalization, lessoning de-escalation efforts. By simulating these interactions, the study seeks to identify how different stimuli affect the mobilization and resilience of vulnerable populations within extremist movements.
